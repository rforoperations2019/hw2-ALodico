The RMD for my leaflet homework (#2) is in the hw2-ALodico folder. 
I started the RMD there along with data in that folder. 
As the RMD progressed, I changed the data inputs to all come from online. 
To preserve the commits, I kept it in the folder, 
because I did not know how to keep the required commit history and move it.
